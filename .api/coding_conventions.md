# üí° Pull Requests
If you want to do a PR, please follow some conventions in your code in order to facilitate reading, refactoring, and communication within the team

## üìô Basics

* Keep your code consistant and follow all the points listed below
* Avoid redundant code, e.g: prefer a function to a pyramid of conditions
* Avoid passing packets through the network unnecessarily (e.g. using the broadcast parameter of `SetValue` when only one client needs it's data)
* Localize your functions/variables/tables/etc.. whenever it's possible, always use the smallest scope possible
* Localize heavy globals on the top of your files when they're called often
* Avoid heavy operations in `Tick` events
* Triple check what's sent by clients throught the network!
* Avoid looping through big tables
* Add validity checks in delayed operations (timers, SQL fetch, etc..)

## üñãÔ∏è Syntax : Variables

* Global vars must be formatted in **PascalCase**
* Local vars must be formatted in **camelCase**
* Enum vars must be formatted in **UPPERCASE**
* It's a general rule (not necessarily a Lua one) that variable names with larger scope should be more descriptive than those with smaller scope
* Variables holding values or objects are typically lowercase and short
* Constants/Enums, particularly ones that are simple values, are often given in `ALL_CAPS`, with words optionally separated by underscores 
* Class names (or at least metatables representing classes) may be mixed case (BankAccount)
* Names starting with an underscore followed by uppercase letters (such as `_VERSION`) are reserved for internal global variables

Indicate the variable type with the first letter of the variable (except for functions and enums):

* **b**Bool
* **i**Int
* **f**Float
* **s**String
* **t**Table
* **x**Undefined
* **o**Object (object using a gamamode class metatable)
* **p**Player (instance of nanos world `Player` class)
* **e**Entity (instance of a nanos world `BaseActor` derived class)

## üòé Syntax : Style
* Indent with 4 spaces
* Use a space after a `--` comment
* Always put a space after commas and assignment signs
* Add brackets to your comparison operations, or your mathematical operations
* Avoid aligning variable declarations
* Indent tables and functions according to the start of the line, not the construct
* False and nil are falsy in conditional expressions. Use shortcuts when you can, unless you need to know the difference between false and nil
* Even though Lua allows it, do not omit parenthesis for functions that take a unique string literal argument
* Prefer function syntax over variable syntax. This helps differentiate between named and anonymous functions
* Perform validation early in your functions, and return as early as possible
